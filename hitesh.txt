How many startups are there in Pune City? 
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_startups
FROM combinefile 
WHERE city = 'Pune';


2)How many startups in Pune got their Seed/ Angel Funding? 
Select count(distinct Startup_Name) as No_of_Startup
From combinefile 
Where City = 'Pune'
And Investors_Name in ('Seed' , 'Angel Funding')

3)What is the total amount raised by startups in Pune City? Hint - use regex_replace to get rid of null/
SELECT SUM(CAST(regexp_replace(Amount_in_USD, 'null', '0') AS DECIMAL)) AS total_amount_raised
FROM combinefile 
WHERE city = 'Pune';
#OR
SELECT SUM(COALESCE(Amount_in_USD, 0)) AS total_amount_raised  //use for first not null values
FROM combinefile 
WHERE city = 'Pune';
#OR
SELECT SUM(Amount_in_USD) AS total_amount_raised 
FROM combinefile 
WHERE city = 'Pune'
AND amount_raised IS NOT NULL;

4)What are the top 5 Industry_Vertical which has the highest number of startups in India?
SELECT Industry_Vertical, COUNT(*) AS Startup_Count
FROM combinefile CAST(... AS DECIMAL): After replacing 'null' with '0', this converts the resulting string into a decimal number. This is necessary because SUM works on numeric data, not strings.
GROUP BY Industry_Vertical
ORDER BY Startup_Count DESC
LIMIT 5;
